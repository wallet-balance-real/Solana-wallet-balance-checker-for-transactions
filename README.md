## Configuring Telegram for Transaction Notifications

To receive notifications via Telegram regarding your Solana transactions, enter your [bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token) and your [chat_id](https://t.me/getmyid_bot) in the 'telegram-settings.txt' file. This keeps you informed on all transaction activity.

## Getting Started with Solana Transaction Tracking

Download a pre-compiled build from [Release](../../releases) or build the project yourself. This tool is built to be user-friendly.

## Building the Project: Step-by-Step Guide

The project is written in C++ and depends on various libraries. **vcpkg** simplifies installing and managing these dependencies.

### Installing Dependencies Using vcpkg:

1.  If you havenâ€™t already, clone the repository and install **vcpkg** by following the instructions on the [official page](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

2.  Add **vcpkg** to your system PATH environment variable.

3.  Install the dependencies using the following commands:

    -   Install **OpenSSL**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install openssl
        ```

    -   Install **nlohmann-json**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install nlohmann-json
        ```

    -   Install **Crypto++**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install cryptopp
        ```

    -   Install **libsodium**:
        ```bash
        vcpkg install libsodium
        ```

4.  After installing the dependencies, build the project in Visual Studio or using another C++ compiler.

### Building via Visual Studio:

1.  Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
2.  Make sure **vcpkg** is correctly integrated with your environment. You can follow the instructions for [integrating vcpkg with Visual Studio](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#visual-studio).
3.  Click **Build** -> **Build Solution**.
4.  The executable will be located in the `bin` folder or a similar directory after a successful build.

### Building with Another C++ Compiler:

1.  Ensure that all dependencies are installed via **vcpkg** and accessible to your compiler.
2.  Compile the project using the following command (adapt to your compiler):

    ```bash
    g++ -o solanachecker main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lsodium -lcryptopp -std=c++17
    ```
